## Overview

Created, administered, and promoted a semi-official online forum for the English Department of Peking University, while I was perusing my graduate studies. Though a volunteer project I did in my free time, the forum became well received by professors, fellow students, alumni, and applicants alike, a convenient online presence of the department where announcements were made, coursework discussed, and resources shared. Frequenters even pitched in 1k+ RMB via my customized online donation system to help me cover for the expenses. The forum's daily new posts reached 200+ at its peak, a respectable number considering its exclusive nature and restricted registration policy.

## The Challenge

- The forum had to be easily accessible on campus, but back then university policy only allowed free access to websites deployed in China, with a 10 times high extra fee for overseas ones!
- Websites deployed in China need to be pre-registered with the government and are strictly monitored for sensitive contents. The extra administrative efforts were too strenuous for a volunteer project.
- Financial costs for running the forum needed to be manageable as it was non-profit.

## Approach & Solution

- Deployed the forum overseas (in Hong Kong) for less governmental supervision but with IPv6 support which is accessible on campus due to Peking University being part of the CERNET(China Education and Research Network).
- Customized and introduced an online donation feature for the forum to ease the financial burden.

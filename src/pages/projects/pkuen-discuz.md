### Overview

Envisioned, customized, deployed, maintained, promoted, and adminstered an semi-official internet forum for the English Department of Peking University, while I was still persuing my graduate studies. Though only a volunteer project I made in my free time, the forum became very well received by professors, my fellow students, alumni, and potential candidates alike, an convenient online presence of the department where announcements were made, coursework discussed, resources shared, and so on. Frequenters even pitched in 1k+ RMB through my customized online donation system to help me cover for the expenses of running the forum. Due to its somewhat exclusive nature, user registration had to be limited, hence the forum's daily new post number only reached a respectable 200+ at its peak. With the introduction of newer social media in the forms of Weibo and Wechat, interests in the forum gradually waned and it was finally shut down and archived in 2016, roughly 5 years after its initial conception.

### The Challenge

- Forum had to be easily accessible on campus, but back then university policy only allowed free access to websites deployed in China, with a 10 times high extra fee for overseas ones!
- Websites deployed in China need to be pre-registered with the government and are strictly monitored for sensitive contents. The extra adminstrive efforts were too strenuous for a volunteer project.
- Financial costs for runing the forum needed to be managable as it was non-profit.

### The Approach & Solution

- Deployed the forum overseas (in Hong Kong) for less governmental supervision but with IPv6 support which is accessible on campus due to Peking University being part of the CERNET(China Education and Research NETwork).
- Customized and introduced an online donation feature for the forum to ease the financial burden.
